# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Sam Lee

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about exploring the basics of Javascripts, including DOMS, as well as incorporating an outside tool that further structurizes the web application. The purpose of this blog is to guide the audience of my progress throughout the school year and help the reader understand more of my thinking and decisions when making my web application.

## Content
For my project, I am making a Homework Organizer that contains a easy-to-use login system and simple add/delete functions with a database that allows saving. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Firebase in order to make my homework organizer.

## Implications
This project could be applied in society as a whole by making it a little easier to take notes. Of course there are multiple ways to take notes, but especially since technology is evolving, there are many ways in which a digital todo list would be beneficial to society. There may be many todo lists online already, however, I did try to create a website myself that could potentially be just as useful.
