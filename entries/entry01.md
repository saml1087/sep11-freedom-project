Some of the tools I've been considering are Node.js and Firebase!
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) are both back-end tools.
This means that they can store data and keep track of information "behind the scenes."
My current stage during the Engineering Design Process is defining the problem.
I've currently defined the problem; which is to find a way to easily jot down homework and assignments digitally.
I'm heading towards the stage of researching the problem, as I will be testing out the tool that I will be exploring: Firebase.
Currently I'm learning the basics of Javascript in class lessons.
At the moment I've learned about arrays which is probably crucial to my project, especially when dealing with storing multiple pieces of data.
In addition, there's been a lot of practice of functions. This is also important as user-input is also important for a "Planner" project.
One skill that I've learned is knowing how to learn. What I mean by this is that I'm able to learn on my own. I haven't gone into deep
"learning on my own" yet, but I am progressing in small steps. This would contribute to learning on my own as one of my current skills.
Another skill that I have is learning how to google. I would say that I would know which sources are credible and which are helpful.
For example, I tend to go to Stack Overflow for tips on overall coding.
Overall, two skills I've learned so far is being able to learn on my own and knowing how to google.
