# Entry 4
##### 4/26/21

Through the course of this entry, I will go through the process of creating the DOM portion of my Freedom Project. As my project is based on saving/documenting assignments that the user is needing to keep track of, I needed to make the application able to process the user's input and display it in a nice "list" format. In addition, I've done more Firestore testing which could potentially be added into my application.

Here is the **timeline** that focuses on what I did this week.

Throughout this project, I've done my testing on my demo-website which is [here](https://ide-28ce95ffd3744292bda1b0e1ac9b55a5-8081.cs50.ws/index.html) for reference. My testing done with Firebase will be located [here](https://replit.com/@SamLee5/Testing-FireStore#script.js).
