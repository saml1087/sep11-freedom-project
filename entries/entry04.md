# Entry 4
##### 4/26/21

Through the course of this entry, I will go through the process of creating the DOM portion of my Freedom Project. As my project is based on saving/documenting assignments that the user is needing to keep track of, I needed to make the application able to process the user's input and display it in a nice "list" format.

Here is the **timeline** that focuses on what I did this week.
